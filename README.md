# Launch School Course LS215 Computational Thinking and Problem Solving

This repository contains practice exercises from Launch School's LS215 course.

## What I learned in this course:

### Programming as a Creative Process

- **Two Key Steps:**
  - **Understanding the Problem:** Build a mental model to solve the problem abstractly.
  - **Implementation:** Code the model using a formal programming language.
- **Focus on Problem Understanding:** This course emphasizes the first step, aiming to teach logical and computational thinking.

### Logical and Computational Thinking

- **Thinking Logically:** Analyze problems, solutions paths, and consider both center and edge cases.
- **Thinking Procedurally:** Use a bottom-up approach with imperative solution expressions.
- **Thinking Abstractly:** Apply a top-down approach with declarative solution expressions.
- **Problem-Solving Patterns:** Learn common patterns for solving problems.

### JavaScript as a Tool

- JavaScript is used as the primary language to express logical solutions, providing a practical way to apply learned concepts.

### Course Content Overview

**List Processing and Functional Abstractions**

- **Functional Programming Concepts:**
  - Passing functions as arguments.
  - Using declarative programming with abstractions.
- **List Processing Patterns:**
  - Iteration, filtering/selection, transformation, reducing/folding, interrogation, and combining abstractions.
- **Exercises:** Total Square Area, Processing Releases, Octal, Anagrams, Formatting Bands.

**String and Text Processing**

- **String Processing Patterns:**
  - Utilize string methods and regular expressions.
- **Exercises:** Reverse a String, Acronym, Email Validation, Matching Parentheses, Sentiment Analysis (1 & 2), Longest Sentence.

**General Problem Solving Approach**

- **The "PEDAC" Process:**
  - **P**roblem: Understand the problem and write test cases.
  - **E**xamples: Create examples/test cases.
  - **D**ata Structure: Work with data structures and algorithms.
  - **A**lgorithm: Translate algorithm steps into code.
  - **C**ode: Run test cases to verify and debug code.
